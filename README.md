# (WIP) Data Exfiltration from PIP'd Employee

## Scenario: 
- An employee named John Doe, working in a sensitive department, recently got put on a performance improvement plan (PIP). After John threw a fit, management has raised concerns that John may be planning to steal proprietary information and then quit the company. Your task is to investigate John's activities on his corporate device (EDR-Test-Vm) using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and ensure nothing suspicious is taking place.
- John is an administrator on his device and is not limited on which applications he uses. He may try to archive/compress sensitive information and send it to a private drive or something.
